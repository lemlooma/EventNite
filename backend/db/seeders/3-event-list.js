The narrative in Prosthetic Location surrounds an unsolved trauma from the artist's own life, not as a linear or static occurrence, but rather a continuum of interpretations, reenactments, and reverberations. For Mian, producing the work is a form of investigative therapy for processing the events and forces that haunt him. Like artmaking, meditation has served an essential and grounding role in Mian’s healing process, often woven into his interdisciplinary practice through a ruminating and introspective approach to sculptural materials as well as incorporation of humming and vibratory sound.",
